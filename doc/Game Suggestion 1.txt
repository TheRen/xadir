What is Areena?

"Old indie game"
Last updated in 2007, unless you count the new browser based game, facebook game and a mobile game.

All of these games utulize the same old gaphics, and the same game mechanics, so id call them the same game. We can do better.

Point in the game was to manage your team of Gladiators and rise in team rankings/ladder and thusly beat the season of matches.

Basics:
- form a team by buying slaves
- buy equipment to your slaves
- win matches to gain money
- get up in the ladder

The game utilizes a slight variation d100 system of roleplaying rules, most likely inspired by the game RuneQuest

Lets say that a character has a skill of 45 in shordsmanship. He has a short sword that deals 1d6 points of damage.

In order for him to hit succesfully his target he needs to get more than 45 from a roll of 100 sided die. After this he will deal damage to his target equal to the damage of his weapon, in this case the number told by a 6 sided die.

In short this is how the combat would work. In time, the weapon skill would increase, for example 1 point per 10 succesful hits, or something like that. He coudl afford a better sword dealing more damage and so on.


What could we make? What could our game be?

- game with better graphics
- more versatile and balanced combat system
- rpg elements, such as creating the team, other than buying pregenerated characters
- music
- the surrounding area would heve greater deal in the tactics
- and best of all, a new Arena game
